* evil-org-mode
This is a package for evil organization; it establishes evil-mode bindings for org-mode.
As it is, this borrows heavily from [[https://github.com/edwtjo][edwtjo's]] [[https://github.com/edwtjo/evil-org-mode][evil-org-mode]].
Having used it, I had a love-hate relationship with it.
The keybindings were convenient, however, there were issues:
- leader commands would override my own
- hitting =O= on a heading would insert another heading above it
The leader part was what got me to make a separate package, because I imagine that some users will want some predefined maps of that sort, but having conflicting bindings and looking to migrate to [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]], I decided that pull requests would not cut it.
